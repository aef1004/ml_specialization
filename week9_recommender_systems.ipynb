    "- recommend items to you based on ratings of users who gave smilar ratins as you\n",

    "Deep learning for Content based filtering\n",

    "1) Retrieval - generate large list of plausible items candidates (Ex. for each of the last 10 movies watched by the user, find 10 most similar movies or from most viewed 3 genres, find the top 10 movies or top 20 movies in country\n",
    "\n",
    "combine retrieved items into list, removing duplicates and items already watched/purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Ranking - take list retrieved and rank using learned model\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes\n",
    "- retrieving more items results in better performance but slower recommendations\n",
    "- To analyze/optimize the trade-off, carry out offline experiements to see if retrieving additional items results in more relevant recommendations (i.e., p(yi,j) = 1 items displayed to user are higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the goal of recommender systems?\n",
    "- movies most likely to be rated 5 stars by users\n",
    "- products most likely to be purchased\n",
    "- ads most likely to be clicked on (high bid)\n",
    "- product generating the largest profit (versus product most useful to you)\n",
    "- video leading to maximum watch time\n",
    "\n",
    "Problematic cases\n",
    "- maximizing user engagement (e.g., watch tine) has led to large social media/video sharing sites to amplify conspiracy theories and hate/toxicity\n",
    "- can a ranking system maximize your profit rather than users' welfare to be presented in a trasparent way"
